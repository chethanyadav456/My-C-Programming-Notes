# Installing GCC C Compiler
- To compile and run C programs, you need to have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

- To install GCC on your system, follow the instructions given below:

### For Windows
- To install GCC on Windows, you can use the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) installer. You can download the MinGW installer from the following link:
  - [MinGW Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)

- After downloading the MinGW installer, follow the instructions given below to install GCC on your system:
    - Run the MinGW installer.
    - Select the packages you want to install (e.g., `mingw32-base`, `mingw32-gcc-g++`, `msys-base`, etc.).
    - Click on the `Install` button to start the installation process.
    - After the installation is complete, you can use the GCC compiler to compile and run C programs.

### For Linux
- To install GCC on Linux, you can use the package manager provided by your distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install GCC using the following command:
  ```sh
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```
- This command will install the necessary packages required for compiling C programs, including the GCC compiler.

### For macOS
- To install GCC on macOS, you can use the Xcode Command Line Tools. You can install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running the following command in the terminal:
  ```sh
  $ xcode-select --install
  ```
- This command will install the necessary tools required for compiling C programs, including the GCC compiler.

- After installing GCC on your system, you can verify the installation by running the following command in the terminal:
  ```sh
  $ gcc --version
  ```
- This command will display the version of the GCC compiler installed on your system.

- Now you are ready to compile and run C programs on your system using the GCC compiler.
